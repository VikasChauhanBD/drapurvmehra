      " Vidya Jeewan - More Than Just a Place, An Experience. Some places change you, shape you, and fill you with the motivation you always longed for. For me, that place was Vidya Jeewan.

Very morning, Apurv Sir’s powerful words set the tone for the day - his motivation wasn’t just about pushing forward, It was about believing in yourself. ",
