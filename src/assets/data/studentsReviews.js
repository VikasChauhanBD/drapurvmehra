Very morning, Apurv Sir's powerful words set the tone for the day - his motivation wasn't just about pushing forward, It was about believing in yourself. ",

Overall Experience Vidya Jeevan has set a high standard for educational institutions. The attention to detail, commitment to excellence, and passion for teaching are truly commendable. I would highly recommend Vidya Jeevan to anyone looking for a supportive and stimulating learning environment. Thank you ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️. ",

      " Vidya Jeevan... The best place to exist in an exam preparing student. This place is perfectly planned & designed solely for the students. All thanks to Dr. Apurv sir, It has all the facilities you'll probably need during preparation top notch reading rooms, perfect Computer Lab so that you can simulate real exam feels to reduce exam fear, best Lecture theatres & The very tiny details probably one might miss they have green leaves like on every pillar around you due to which the eyes don't fatigue even after 13 hours class & One thing the best (since I'm a foodie). The main concern we have is what we'll eat during these 4 days or even if you're for bootcamp during the stay they have the best food in their premises only. Breakfast, Lunch, Evening Snacks & Dinner & They also have a cafeteria in the campus if you wish to eat other than this time. You just have to study show up daily everything is well managed by the team so efficiently. Everyday starts by motivation by Dr. Apurv sir you'll never feel that you can't do this or that...so highly motivating. Coming to Vidya Jeevan was the bestttt decision we made. Tip: if you're coming here to study, Just show up daily & rest all things have been managed by the team. You'll never feel away from home. Truly an experience centre❤️. ",

      " The first impression of the place radiates so much positivity, the beautiful building and the fountain just as you enter your see some beautiful motivating quotes from all faculties and a big omkar which radiates so much positivity and fills the morning with positivity. Dr. Apurva sir makes sure he is at the centre by 6.45 AM even before the students so that not a single student has to face even a second of delay. The food at Vidya Jeevan is really nice, less spicy, healthy on gut and they have really tried that you don't miss home much. The cafeteria is such a good place to both study and chill. Where you can discuss with friends and study or can study alone or just have a coffee break. There is a bakery also which serves amazing coffee, pastry and sandwiches if you feel hungry midway between the day. The whole staff at vidya Jeevan is so so helpful and respectful they don't make you feel that you are here for drop or something of that kind, they treat you like doctors and are so respectful which is so heartwarming. There are two big computer labs in Vidya Jeevan for exam simulation where tests and GTs are organised so that we give them on desktop and we don't have any exam anxiety and exam feels like any other tests. Dr. Apurv Sir not only teaches ortho and makes it easy but imbibes values in us to be a good human and every morning keeps us reminding of our purpose which becomes very important in this long journey. There are study cubicles with pcs which gives very amazing place to study. You can study at any place you want there is complete freedom to use the place for betterment of students. probably the only ethical players in NEET PG coaching market who do not look towards as some money minting machine but as our students and a extended family and I am not doing any kind of exaggeration. VIDYA JEEVAN IS ESSENTIALLY AN EXPERIENCE TO WHICH WORDS WILL NOT GIVE JUSTICE... If you are thinking of joining it just go for it. no second thoughts it's the best and most unique one you'll get. ",

    review:
      " Vidya Jeevan INICET & NEET PG Coaching – A Journey of Rediscovery. I belong to the 2017 MBBS batch, and my academic journey has been far from smooth. The atmosphere in my undergraduate college wasn't very supportive of learning, but I did my best to stick to the main notes till final year. After my final year results, 2022 was a complete blank due to some exceptional personal circumstances. My internship got delayed and I finally completed it on August 15, 2024. Despite the long gap, I started regaining my momentum around April 2024. I gave NEET PG 2024, where I got 108 corrects, though the rest were negatives. Unfortunately, due to health issues, I couldn't appear for INICET November 2024. I returned home on September 2, 2024, and after some thought, I finally joined Vidya Jeevan on December 18, 2024. That decision changed everything. Having lost touch with the syllabus and being a naturally slow learner, I needed time and strong guidance to bounce back. At Vidya Jeevan, I got exactly that. Under the compassionate and structured mentorship of Dr. Apurv Sir, I finally found the direction I had been missing for so long. I gave INICET May 2025 and managed 106 corrects with 93 negatives. Not perfect, but for someone catching up after years, it was a milestone. Now with NEET PG 2025 delayed by two months, I finally feel confident and well-oriented. I'm also aiming for INICET November 2025, because I now believe I can aim higher. Joining Vidya Jeevan has been the most transformative step of my journey. This place didn't just revive my preparation—it revived my belief in myself, Forever grateful. ",
