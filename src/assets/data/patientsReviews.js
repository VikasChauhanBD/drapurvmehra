He has operated on several members of my family, including my father, and each time showed exceptional medical expertise along with genuine compassion and care. His calm nature, patience, and reassuring communication gave us great confidence during difficult moments. He treats patients and families with empathy and respect, and his people management skills are outstanding. The staff is also very kind, supportive, and professional.

      " I am extremely grateful to Dr. Apurva Mehra of Vidya Jeevan Clinic for his exceptional professionalism, skill, and compassion. He treated my mother for total knee replacement of both knees, which were in a critical condition, with remarkable care and precision. From the very first consultation through surgery and recovery, Dr. Mehra demonstrated not only medical excellence but also genuine empathy and patience. He took the time to explain every step clearly, addressed all our concerns, and ensured my mother felt confident and comfortable throughout the treatment journey. Thanks to his expertise and dedicated care, my mother's recovery has been smooth and her quality of life has improved significantly. Dr. Mehra is truly an outstanding doctor who combines deep knowledge with a humane approach. I highly recommend him to anyone seeking expert orthopedic care. I would also like to thanks his team member, Chetan, who had help us in even step from hospital admission till discharge and later for follow up visits. ",

      " Six months post surgery, and I still feel grateful every day. From the first consultation, all my fears and questions were met with patience and clarity. The procedure itself felt safe and comfortable and the post-surgery care has been exceptional. After living with pain for 8 years, I finally remember how it feels to exist without it. I feel reborn, stronger than ever. Dr. Apurv and his entire team truly changed my life. Thank you every single one of you🥹. ",

      " Doctor bhagwan ka roop hota hai - this truly holds true for Dr. Apurv Mehra. He performed my mother's (Kusum Nayyar) knee surgery with such care and precision, but what touched us most was his continuous support post - surgery. Even weeks later, he kept checking in personally and guiding us with utmost compassion. His presence gave us positivity and comfort during a difficult time. We genuinely felt he was taking on our pain as his own. A special thank you also to his wonderful team - Mahender, Navin, and others - who were always just a call away. We are overwhelmed and deeply grateful. Thank you, Dr. Mehra, for being such a blessing. ",
